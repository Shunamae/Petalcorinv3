        <h1>My Testimonials</h1>
        
        <p> &nbsp;               My testimony from the very first to the very last ICT training session at Northern Bukidnon State College. </p>
       <p>  &nbsp;             Firstly, I would want to express my gratitude to Maam Kristine Delos Santos, the ALS Coordinator, for providing me with the chance to participate in this program. Additionally, thanks to Ms. Cristine Sagaosao, our training instructor, who along with the co-teacher/instructors facilitated this activity. And to everyone involved in this activity training.</p>
       <P>  &nbsp;             Based on my experience during Sir Jess. Bernaldez first session of class discussion is all about giving Essential part of Desktop or Personal Computer and he shared about the topic of hardware and software. During that time, it was a very good activity because he teaches us how to make sure that our pc is applicable in order to buy a new one. On what’s the specs need to verify and carry for all the apps you to installed. And also, for the 2nd session Sir. Jess Teach about basic trouble shooting about Back panel and Front panel it is very useful to us specially the inside and outside of the case on what are functions of the buttons.</P> 
       <p>  &nbsp;             For our 3rd session handled by one of our Instructor Ms. Phoebe Ruth Sudaria which is she teach us about making Spreadsheet or open spreadsheet through Microsoft excel and also, she taught us about making chart in spreadsheets in easy way. I like this topic since it is useful every time making grades and of course for the thesis since a took up master’s degree.</p>
       <p>  &nbsp;             For the next session which is taught by Ms. Charlene it is all about to getting the formulas of Sum, Average, Max and Min, Count, Count A and Round, this formula is very useful in making grades to the learners it is easy to calculate.</p>
       <p>  &nbsp;             For the 5th session of the class, they are two teachers who facilitate that time, the first one handled by Ms. Marchlyn Abunda who taught us about the Presentation Software Application which is used to create slide presentation of texts, pictures, audios and videos, as well as together with Ms. Mitch Turtor who finalizing the Presentation outputs. They taught us to create PowerPoint easy way and useful to everybody specially to our learners.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;             Additionally, our 7th and last session handled by our Last Instructor Sir. Cliff Evangelio that he taught us about Web Development which is HTML and CSS. HTML is building sites and Applications for the World Wide Web. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Languages while the CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This topic is attentive or should I say it is center of interest because crucial to our learners as well to the teacher to know the important in creating Web Development. </p>
